                        <p>
                            <!-- I don’t need Heaven or stars. When I met you, I gained a steady hand, a kind soul, and someone with whom I can fall asleep and wake up next for the rest of my life. You are my heart – you are my everything.  -->
                            As I sit here and reflect on the beautiful journey we've shared together, I am overwhelmed with gratitude for having you in my life. I want you to know that you mean more to me than any heavenly constellation or starry sky ever could. You are my guiding light, my steady hand through life's uncertainties, and the embodiment of kindness and warmth.
                        </p>
